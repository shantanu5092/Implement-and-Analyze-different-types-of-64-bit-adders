# Implement-and-Analyze-different-types-of-64-bit-adders
The purpose of this project is to implement, optimize and analyze performance of 4 different implementations of 64-bit adders: 
(1) Ripple-Carry-Adder (RCA), 
(2) Carry-Look-Ahead (CLA- 2L) with 4-bit groups and 2-level P-G generator, 
(3) Carry Selected Adder (CSA-EQG) with 4- bit groups and,
(4) Carry Selected Adder (CSA-UEQG) with unequal-bit groups for highest speedup.
